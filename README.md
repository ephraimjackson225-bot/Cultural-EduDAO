# 🌍 Cultural EduDAO: Decentralized Curation of Culturally Relevant Education

Welcome to Cultural EduDAO, a revolutionary Web3 project on the Stacks blockchain that empowers communities to curate, fund, and distribute educational materials tailored to diverse cultural contexts! In a world where mainstream education often overlooks cultural nuances, this DAO solves the real-world problem of limited access to inclusive, culturally sensitive learning resources. By leveraging blockchain, we ensure transparent governance, fair funding, and immutable ownership—making education more equitable and community-driven.

## ✨ Features

🗳️ DAO voting for curation and approval  
💰 Treasury funding for creators via grants  
📚 Immutable storage of approved materials with metadata  
👥 Membership tiers for contributors and educators
